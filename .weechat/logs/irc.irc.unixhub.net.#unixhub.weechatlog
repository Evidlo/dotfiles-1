2013-11-01 16:53:04	+ampharos	ksh is bourne compatible
2013-11-01 16:53:06	+ampharos	zsh is not
2013-11-01 16:54:22	+dcat	only downside to ksh for me is that I can't `bind ^L=clear-screen`
2013-11-01 16:54:22	+eregus	ampharos: mksh is pdksh successor of pdksh
2013-11-01 16:54:34	+ampharos	except you know openbsd maintained pdksh
2013-11-01 16:55:53	+evo	So.. IE11 Might actually be decent

2013-11-04 11:33:39	+bottomy	affects other apps when I checked them (so seems like a system issue rather than an app bug), but don't use them (e.g. safari) so doesn't matter there. but Xcode grr, too many of my larger projects depend on it especially my ios ones.
2013-11-04 11:33:57	+afiun	no it does not
