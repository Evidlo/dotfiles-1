eng89's Arch + bspwm

This set up uses:
+  bspwm - to manage windows
+  termite - my terminaljb
+  sxhkd - hotkeys and stuff
+  weechat - chat
+  BAR - status bar

For making things look nice, i use
+  hsetroot - to set wallpaper
+  compton - to set shadows / transparency of windows

Thanks to earsplit for showing us bspwm noobs the way.
